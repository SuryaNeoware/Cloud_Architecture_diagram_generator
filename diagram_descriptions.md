
### Architecture description:

1. Simple Web Application
A web application with the following components:

A Load Balancer routes incoming traffic to two EC2 Instances running the application.
An RDS Database stores user data.
A S3 Bucket is used for storing static assets like images and CSS.
Connections:

The Load Balancer connects to both EC2 Instances.
Both EC2 Instances connect to the RDS Database.
The EC2 Instances also fetch static assets from the S3 Bucket.

2. Serverless Data Processing
A serverless architecture for processing user data:

An API Gateway receives incoming user requests and forwards them to a Lambda Function.
The Lambda Function processes the data and stores it in a DynamoDB Table.
Processed data is backed up into an S3 Bucket.
A CloudWatch service monitors all activity.
Connections:

The API Gateway connects to the Lambda Function.
The Lambda Function connects to both the DynamoDB Table and the S3 Bucket.
All components send logs to CloudWatch.


3. E-Commerce Platform
An e-commerce platform with the following components:

CloudFront CDN provides content delivery.
A Load Balancer manages traffic to EC2 Instances hosting the application.
A RDS Database stores customer and order data.
A Lambda Function runs periodic data analysis on the database.
Static files like product images are stored in an S3 Bucket.
SNS is used to send order confirmation emails.
Connections:

The CloudFront CDN connects to the Load Balancer.
The Load Balancer connects to multiple EC2 Instances.
The EC2 Instances connect to the RDS Database and retrieve static files from the S3 Bucket.
The Lambda Function connects to the RDS Database.
The SNS connects to the Lambda Function for sending notifications.


4. Big Data Pipeline
A big data pipeline with the following components:

A Kinesis Data Stream ingests real-time data.
A Lambda Function processes the streaming data.
Processed data is stored in an S3 Bucket for batch analysis.
A Redshift Cluster is used for advanced analytics and reporting.
Athena queries the data stored in S3.
CloudWatch monitors the entire pipeline.
Connections:

The Kinesis Data Stream connects to the Lambda Function.
The Lambda Function connects to the S3 Bucket.
The S3 Bucket connects to both Redshift and Athena.
All services send logs to CloudWatch.


5. Microservices Architecture
A microservices setup with the following components:

A Load Balancer directs traffic to two Microservices running on EC2 Instances.
Microservice A handles authentication and connects to an RDS Database for user data.
Microservice B handles product listings and connects to a DynamoDB Table.
Both microservices send logs to CloudWatch.
Connections:

The Load Balancer connects to both Microservices.
Microservice A connects to the RDS Database.
Microservice B connects to the DynamoDB Table.
Both Microservices connect to CloudWatch.

2. ELB connects to ASG
3.  ASG connects to the two EC2 instances
4.  Two EC2 instances connect to the RDS database.
5. Two EC2 instances connect to S3
5. RDS connects to Payment Gateway


7. Azure: 
Title: "Serverless Event-Driven Architecture"

Components:
1. Event Hub
2. Azure Functions
3. Cosmos DB
4. Power BI
5. Azure Storage
6. Custom Icon: Include a placeholder icon for a proprietary "Data Transformer" module in the processing pipeline.

Connections: 


8. GCP: Machine Learning Pipeline

9. Hybrid: Multi-Cloud Data Lake Architecture
Description:
A hybrid multi-cloud data lake setup using services from AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Components:
AWS S3: Main data lake for raw storage.
Azure Data Factory: Orchestrate ETL pipelines.
GCP BigQuery: Analytics on curated datasets.
Custom Icon: Placeholder for "On-Premise Database" connecting to both AWS and Azure through a VPN tunnel.
Azure ExpressRoute and AWS Direct Connect: Ensure secure connectivity between the clouds and on-premises data.

10. Custom Icon Heavy: IoT Smart Factory System
Description:
An IoT-based architecture for monitoring and managing a smart factory.

Components:
AWS IoT Core: Manage IoT devices.
GCP Cloud IoT Core: Analyze data streams from devices.
Azure Digital Twins: Model and visualize the factory floor.
Custom Icons:
